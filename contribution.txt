In the group, I was globally the main contributor on website and poster.
More specifically, I firstly build the project architecture; git initialization, web hosting, first website version, C compressing program and Makefile.
I made the data parsing program to compress one of the two data files. Homicide file were too heavy to be processed in js during each page loading.
I developed the vast majority of css and html code and a significant part of the js program.
I also made the poster.
Finally, I slightly helped to correct the report.
